# Phonebook
Program to simulate the actions of an electronic phonebook.  This program is able to add new contacts with the information of first name, last name, street address, city, state, ZIP code, and telephone number.  The program is able to search for existing contacts by first name, last name, full name, city, state, or telephone number and is able to update and delete contacts as well.  The program can take all the contact information in a string in the following format: "first name last name, street address, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number" and format the name and address as they would appear on any piece of mail, and convert the telephone number (even if entered ##########) to the format (###) ###-####.  The program can also print all the contacts in the phonebook in alphabetical order by last name and will keep running until the user selects the "Exit program" option.  Runs from Application.java.
