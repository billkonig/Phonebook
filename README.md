# Phonebook
Program to simulate the actions of a phonebook.  The program is able to add new contacts with the information of first name, last name, 
street address, city, state, zipcode, and telephone number.  The program is able to search for existing contacts by first name, last name, 
full name, city, state, or telephone number, regardless of upper or lowercase, and is able to update and delete contacts as well.  The 
program can take all the contact information in a string in the following format - first name last name, street address, city, state, 
zipcode, telephone number and format it properly.  For example: Contact input - John Doe, 114 Market St., St Louis, MO, 63403, 6366435698
gives the output - 
John Doe
114 Market St.
St Louis, MO 63403
(636) 643-5698
The program can also print all the contacts in the phonebook and will keep running until the user selects the "Exit program" option.
